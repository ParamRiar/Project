            <h2>Diwali </h2>
            <p>Deepavali or Diwali is the Hindu festival of lights celebrated every year in autumn in the northern hemisphere (spring in southern hemisphere). It is an official holiday in Fiji, Guyana, India, Malaysia, Mauritius, Myanmar, Nepal, Singapore, Sri Lanka, Suriname, Trinidad and Tobago, and recently Sindh Province in Pakistan. One of the most popular festivals of Hinduism, it spiritually signifies the victory of light over darkness, good over evil, knowledge over ignorance, and hope over despair.Its celebration includes millions of lights shining on housetops, outside doors and windows, around temples and other buildings in the communities and countries where it is observed. The festival preparations and rituals typically extend over a five-day period, but the main festival night of Diwali coincides with the new moon night of the Hindu Lunisolar month Kartika in Bikram Sambat calendar (the month of Aippasi in Tamil Calendar), on the 15th of the month. In the Gregorian calendar, Deepavali night falls between mid-October and mid-November.

We combed through tons of party and events listings to find you the very best of what the city has to offer this year. There are parties for people who like to get gussied up and there are more low-key options for people who prefer a more casual affair: from a night at the opera, to a Nashville-themed country-music bash, to an all-ages ice-skating party by the lake, there’s something here for every NYE reveler on December 31.
